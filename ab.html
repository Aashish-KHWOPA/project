    <h1>The Snake Game</h1>

   

    <p>The Snake Game is a classic arcade game that originated in the late 1970s. It became widely popular in the late
        1990s with the introduction of mobile phones, particularly Nokia phones that came preloaded with the game. The
        game has since been recreated and adapted for various platforms.</p>

    <h2>Objective:</h2>

    <p>The objective of the Snake Game is simple yet challenging. Players control a snake that moves around a bordered
        playing field. The goal is to eat food (often represented by a dot or another small item) that appears randomly
        on the screen. As the snake consumes the food, it grows longer. The player must navigate the snake to avoid
        collisions with the game boundaries and, more critically, with its own tail. The game becomes progressively
        difficult as the snake grows longer, making it a test of both strategy and reflexes.</p>

    <h2>Basic Gameplay:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The game starts with a small snake on the screen.</li>
        <li>The player controls the snake's direction, typically using arrow keys or other input methods.</li>
        <li>Food items appear at random locations on the screen.</li>
        <li>When the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer.</li>
        <li>The player earns points for each piece of food consumed.</li>
        <li>The game ends if the snake collides with the game boundaries or with its own tail.</li>
    </ul>

    

    <h2>Challenges:</h2>

    <p>The Snake Game presents challenges as the snake grows longer and the playing field becomes more crowded.
        Maneuvering the snake without colliding with the walls or itself requires skill and foresight. The pace of the
        game often increases as the snake gets longer, adding an element of urgency.</p>
